{"name":"Lance F Barker on Github","tagline":"What the hell am I up to here?","body":"### Welcome To My GitHub Page.\r\nI am a retired teacher on a mission to learn to code -- an old dog wanting to learn some new tricks. I've had some ideas for an education oriented app or two floating around in my head for a while now that I just can't seem to shake out.\r\n\r\n### No Previous Experience\r\nLookout. I have no idea what I'm doing. I don't consider myself a programmer type (although I've created a website or two from time to time). But how hard could it be?\r\n\r\n### Meteor!\r\nI've discovered Meteor and I'm determined to use it to build my app. I look forward to the benefit of deploying on iOS and Android if it make sense to go that way. Currently I'm learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript and playing around with the Meteor tools. Honestly, it's overwhelming, but I'm going to carry on.\r\n\r\n### First things\r\nMy first app is going to be a proverb dictionary. I hope it will be of some benefit to any of my adult literacy students. Before I get there, I aim to play around with some different learning approaches. Checkout my repos for what I'm currently working on.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nIf you happen upon this page and you're at all interested in support, collaboration or advice, don't hesitate to drop me a line at lancefb at gmail dot com.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
