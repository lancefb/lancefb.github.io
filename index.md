### Welcome To My GitHub Page.
I am a retired teacher who enjoys tinkering with code. I've had some ideas for an education oriented app or two floating around in my head for a while now that I just can't seem to shake out.

### Data visualization
This is my current interest. I took a university level statistics class many years ago and I want to continue learning about data manipulation, statistical wrangling and making pictures out of numbers. Currently studying R and Shiny.

### Meteor!
Meteor was my first experience and although I have moved on, I still have some code for an app project lying around. My first app was shaping up to be a proverb dictionary. I had intended it to be of some benefit to any of my adult literacy students. I'm not currently planning on any more work on this project.
