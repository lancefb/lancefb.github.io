## Overview

Most AI content teaches you to do more. This project is about using AI to *be* better.

Better citizen. Better learner. Better parent. Better neighbor. Better thinker.

Not productivity hacks. Personal growth.

## What It Is

A platform combining short, practical ebooks with guided AI experiences — giving people a way to actually *use* AI for the things that matter, not just stare at a blank prompt.

## Status

In development. More details coming soon.
