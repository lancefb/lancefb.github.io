## Overview

**PAI (Personal AI Infrastructure)** is a self-learning system that gets better at helping you over time.

Unlike static AI assistants that treat every conversation as a blank slate, PAI captures feedback from every interaction and uses it to improve.

## The Problem

The most powerful AI systems are being built inside companies for companies. The richest people and the biggest corporations are getting AI that learns from every interaction and gets better at helping them over time.

**Everyone deserves that.**

## The Solution

PAI exists to democratize access to self-learning AI infrastructure:
- **Persistent memory** - Your AI remembers past sessions, decisions, and learnings
- **Custom skills** - Specialized capabilities for the things you do most
- **Your context** - Goals, contacts, preferences available without re-explaining
- **Intelligent routing** - The right workflow triggers automatically
- **Self-improvement** - The system modifies itself based on what it learns
