*The Whim That Stuck*

Well, I did it.

I bought a house. In Quincy, California.

[![](/images/cf137d1de682_Qhouse.jpg)](/images/063a7c41feb7_Qhouse.jpg)

It has a creaky entry, a roof that looks like it’s held together with good intentions, and a view that will inspire absolutely no one.

I’m not moving there just yet—give me a few weeks to pack up my old life—but the deal is done. No turning back.

New city. New life. New chapter. Cue the dramatic music.

Was this a carefully planned decision?

Absolutely not. It was a whim. A nudge from the universe. A whisper that said, *Why not?***

And now here I am, trying to organize my entire existence on a three-week timeline. Plotting a future in a neighborhood I’ve only driven through once. Wondering if this house is a Rorschach test I’m supposed to live inside.

WTF am I doing?

Honestly? I have no idea.

But I’m doing it anyway.
