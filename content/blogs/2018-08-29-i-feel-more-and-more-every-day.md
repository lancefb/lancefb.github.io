*as my imagination strengthens, that I do not live in this world alone but in a thousand worlds. *(John Keats)

I have had the great pleasure of making art as a collaboration with a lovely young woman who lives not far from me. She is an amazing and beautiful person, an aerial silks artist and circus performer, among other things.

Together we have performed locally, she on the silks and me watching her and playing accordion extemporaneously, trying to match her gestures with music.

This makes me so happy. I live for these kind of experiences.

Thank you Chelsea.
