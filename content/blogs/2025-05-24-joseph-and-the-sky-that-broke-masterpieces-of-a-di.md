*I found this one at the dump. I reminded me of my great-grandfather, Joe and his eldest son - my grandfather, Forrest. The painting is real and the story is true-ish.*

They say it started with the wind. Not the kind that passes through, but the kind that stays. Hangs in the air. Gnaws on your skin. Teaches you how to live small.

Joseph York was a farmer in western Oklahoma. The kind of man who didn’t waste a word or a meal. He and his wife had five children, and they all lived in a house that leaned a little too far to the east—like it, too, had started to give in.

By 1930, the sky had turned mean. Rain stopped visiting. The crops died with their roots curled like fists, and the dirt began to lift—at first just a haze on the horizon, then something closer to judgment.

One day, Joseph saw the sky fold in on itself. Dust boiled up across the field like smoke from a fire that hadn’t started yet. He called for the children. Told Forrest, the eldest, to pack what they could into the truck. Told the others not to look back.

But Forrest—he did.

And what he saw stayed with him for the rest of his life:

His father, standing in the doorway, one hand on the frame, the other shielding his eyes as the land he had worked his whole life became a memory he couldn’t hold onto. The dust didn’t just take the farm. It took the years that built it.

That’s the moment this painting captures—or seems to.

It’s not signed. Not dated. Just left behind at the dump like a story someone didn’t want to tell anymore.

But I think it’s Joseph.

Or maybe it’s every Joseph who stood still just long enough to lose everything but the will to keep going.
