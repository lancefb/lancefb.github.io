I moved out of my house right away. Not because of the Sav-More situation and the lack of facilities, but because the place depressed me. Why? It's a filthy hovel.

Yes, it's coming along and it has potential, but it's also overwhelmingly ... messed up.  It's painful for me to be there, because it reflects my inability to make things happen there without help.  And, because it's just buttugly.

I don't know what else to do but just keep slogging it out as best I can.
