There's a particular cup at my favorite café in Quincy, Brew haha.

It's not just a cup, it's the cup—the one they always seem to hand me, even if I don't ask. Red on the outside, patterned like someone took the time to make something decorative just for the joy of it. Thick-walled. Just the right heft. It fits the hand like it knows the weight of slow mornings and second chances.

And the drink? Always the same.

Not out of habit, but because this one is just… so. It lands perfectly in that narrow gap between bitter and comfort, with milk frothed into silk and a leaf—or a heart, or a flame—floating in the center like some caffeinated mandala.

I come here often. Same corner. Same chipped glass table. Usually with my fur babies. Same invisible rhythm of espresso, milk, and steam.

It's not profound. It's not life-changing.

But it's mine.

And in today's world seemingly wired for chaos and strife, there's something revolutionary in returning to a small ritual that asks for nothing but your presence and your gratitude.

Some days, this cup is enough.
