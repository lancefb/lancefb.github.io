It's been 3 long years since the last Plumas Homegrown Americana Festival. One year was canceled due to Covid, the next due to the Dixie Fire. This year it was hot but we pulled it off and it was fun! I have my own section of the festival with a stage as well as several pop-up tents for work/play shops.[![](/images/8883672d3a98.jpg)](/images/ffc4341553a9_RBonBarkys.jpeg)Rickety Bridge on Barky's Stage
