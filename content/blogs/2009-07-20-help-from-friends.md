I have had an ongoing problem with my front door. It's the result of poor design. The roof slopes over the entrance which means all precipitation including snow ends up dumping right in front of the door. I asked a carpenter friend to help out by coming up with a simple solution to extend the overhang to 3 feet in front of the entrance door. He did. It works. Couldn't have done it myself.

It took the 3 of us about 7 hours from start to finish. I will need to paint and touch up but that won't happen until after the siding goes up. Cost: about $600.00
