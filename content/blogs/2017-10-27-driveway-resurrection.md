I've had this 35 ft 5th wheel trailer in my driveway for 14 years!

I bought it about a year after I bought the house so that my parents could come to stay without having to deal with coming into a ... filthy hovel.

It worked. They stayed for a week or two at a time. But they are gone and I have been wanting to get rid of it for a very long time. Finally a few weeks ago I made it happen.

Now for some painting and trim work.
