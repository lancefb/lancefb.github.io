Some water pipes broke. Again. Winter, apparently, holds a grudge.

  

The break is in a cruel spot—just under the bathroom floor. Close enough to hear the drip, far enough to be unreachable by any civilized posture. I peer through the access opening and see what appears to be a metallic bowl of spaghetti assembled by a sleep-deprived raccoon. Pipes crossing pipes, angles defying reason. Nothing labeled. Nothing obvious. Just a cold, damp riddle.

  

It becomes clear: I have to go under the house.

  

I have never been under my house.

  

This feels like discovering there is a basement beneath your mind you’ve politely ignored for years.

  

I start suiting up as if preparing for war. Old jeans. Thick shirt. Gloves. Hat. Headlamp strapped on like a miner from 1910. Knee pads. The whole ensemble says, “I am brave,” while my pulse says, “You are not.”

  

Crawlspaces are not built for reflection. They are built for necessity. Low beams. Dirt. The sense that you are entering the backstage of your own life. I am claustrophobic. Not in theory. In practice. The kind where the ceiling feels closer than it is and the air feels thinner than physics allows.

  

But water doesn’t care about my psychology. It just keeps leaking.

  

So I lower myself down and begin the crawl. The house above me—my floors, my walls, my tidy illusions—suddenly feels provisional. Held up by wood, pipes, gravity, and a certain amount of denial.

  

Underneath, everything is exposed. The guts of the place. The hidden compromises. The “good enough” decisions made decades ago by someone else with a wrench and a deadline.

  

I inch forward on elbows and knees, headlamp cutting a narrow tunnel through dust and shadow. Every creak sounds like a structural confession. Every cobweb feels like a boundary crossed.

  

And yet, as the panic hums in the background, something steadier emerges. Curiosity. Systems. Cause and effect. Water travels. Pipes connect. There is logic here, even if it’s buried in grime.

  

Fear, I’m discovering, is often just unfamiliarity in dramatic costume.

  

Somewhere beneath the bathroom, among the cold joists and tangled lines, is a small fracture in a copper vein. Find it. Understand it. Repair it.

  

The war, it turns out, is mostly with my own imagination.

  

The house is not trying to swallow me. It is simply asking to be known.
