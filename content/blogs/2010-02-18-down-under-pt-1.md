## To review:

- Some water pipes broke (again) in my house during the last freeze

- The break is in a difficult place to fix, just under the floor in the bathroom

- Peering under, there is a jumbled mess I can't understand

- I decide I must go under the house to see if it can be fixed there and to try to make sense of what is what.

- I have never been under my house.

- It scares me. I'm claustrophobic.
