this house is my wound

shame blocks the sharing of it

no one can truly see it

i can't even bear to take it's true measure

of my debasement

so, i deflect with typical banter

of minor struggles

and hope for fraternal sympathy

while it sits there and waits

night after night, dark and cold,

waiting for me to do something

while i cover my ears

avoiding at all costs

the cries

of skeletons in the cupboard
