With my friend Tony helping me out,  we prepared to go down under.  I borrowed a pair of coveralls, and we got lights and some tools in place.

After having widened the access hole and clearing away as much stuff as possible, I tried to go in head first.

It didn't work. I had to do something about a pipe in the way. After backing out, I went in again with a reciprocating saw to cut off the abandoned galvanized pipe. There was also a gas pipe coming out. Couldn't cut that! Being used. Tony did a good job of keeping it out of my.

Next I tried going in feet first. Got fully inside but just couldn't see how to move on to where I needed to go. I was feeling frustrated and a little panicky in the confined space.

Screw it. I'm a failure. I'm out of here.

We decided at that point to go back into the bathroom to see if there was any way to get at the pipes from the small hole in the floor.

But it was just too hard to get to the pipes. Feeling deflated, I decided to try one more time to go under.
