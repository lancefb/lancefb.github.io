I occasionally work for a local food bank called Community Action Network. It's a great service to a community that has people in need. They distribute food for free to folks that need it. I like to help out and I get some free food. I'm amazed how much overproduction of food there is floating around. The are a lot of canned goods, but loads of fresh foods too. Much of it is approaching expiration. If you go look you can find surprises there.

Food losses and waste amounts to roughly US$ 680 billion in industrialized countries and US$ 310 billion in developing countries.
