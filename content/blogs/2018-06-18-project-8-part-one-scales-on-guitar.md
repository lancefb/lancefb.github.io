Again, weird that I haven't learned this by now. So, here we go. First I want to learn the Pentatonic Scales all over the neck.

7/14/18

Another long term project! Rather than pentatonic, I'm thinking of learning the major scale first, reasoning that all other scales can be derived from it. So many different approaches CAGED, 3 notes per string, etc.
