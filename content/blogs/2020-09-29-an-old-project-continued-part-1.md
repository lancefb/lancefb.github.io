It's been much longer than I expected but I have finally gotten around to working on the electrical rebuild of the Beaver, my ancient RV.  It was back in December of 2017 I started implementing a plan to upgrade the electrical system. I bought books, I studied, I ordered parts, I jumped in.  Then it got too cold and other projects seemed more important so I let it go. I figured it was a good enough start.

But after the evacuation I realized that I need to get this done so that I throw things in the the Beaver and leave it I needed to.

I started reacquainting myself with what I had done. Jesus, I've forgotten so much of it that it scares me! Early onset dementia?

I needed to make some changes but I'm moving forward with the idea of separating the chassis (starter) batteries and the house batteries. At this point I have two chassis batteries separated by a switch using starter type batteries - not deep-cell. I have one deep-cell battery for the house load but will probably add another at some point.

I need to hack into the existing system, keep the parts that work and remove the parts that don't. The main access point is in the kitchen area above the sink (above) and consists of the 120VAC entry and the 120 to 12V converter with a switch that toggles the battery and the converter to the 12V loads consisting of lights, water pump, etc.

I'm taking it slow but steady, adding parts daily.
