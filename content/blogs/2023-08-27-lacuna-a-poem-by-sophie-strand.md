LACUNA

A small comfort to know you already have lips, eyelashes, a bellybutton, a way of taking coffee; already have friends, ticket stubs, scars,

a favorite book, a least favorite book, lovers, although I do not yet know your name. A small comfort to know you have a name although I have never yet said hello

to your hello, held your hands in my hands. And it is delicious to imagine you have a mountain you like to climb – that perhaps you sit at the summit

as I am doing now, on my mountain, and you rest your chin on your knee, watching the valley shiver like a yellow sea of leaves. You have already wept.

And sorrowed. And mourned. As I have wept. And sorrowed. And mourned. What have you lost? What are you going to lose?

Are you are worried I do not exist? Let reassure you, I exist. I exist. Let me find comfort in the word you even if you have not yet arrived to fill it.

*- Sophie Strand*
