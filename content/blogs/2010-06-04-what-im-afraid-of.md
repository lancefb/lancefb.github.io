When it comes to the hovel, I'm afraid of things I don't know and don't understand.  I have put off doing a thorough inspection of this house for years.  I guess I didn't want to know what is really going on under the floor and above the ceiling, partly because it is a huge mess and partly the feeling that I wouldn't understand what is going on anyway.  The stuff I've looked at so far just doesn't look good. What frightens me is the prospect of finding things that will require a huge amount of work and expense.

But now that I have some help and support, I'm ready to face this (not that it'll be any less painful).
