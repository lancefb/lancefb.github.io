I decided to test out some of Google’s newer AI tools—specifically, NotebookLM. I was curious about their podcast generation feature, and figured: why not throw something personal into the machine and see what comes out?

So I uploaded a story—one I’d written about a conversation I once had with my grandmother, Nana.  A quiet memory, dusted off and given a slight narrative shine.

I fed it into NotebookLM, clicked the “generate podcast” button, and waited. It took about 15 minutes.

Below is the story.

And then—what the AI did with it.

Before my grandmother passed from this earth, I often sat beside her, eager for the stories she lovingly shared. I called her Nana—an extraordinary woman whose wisdom and humor shaped much of my childhood. Between the ages of five and thirteen, I lived with my grandparents in their creaky, comforting home in Pasadena, California. They had returned to the U.S. after my Grandpa retired from a life of ministry, the last chapter of which unfolded in Peru. But Nana wasn't ready to put her curiosity to rest, finding creative ways to raise funds so she could continue exploring the world. Her adventures gave her stories—and lessons—that deeply influenced me.

On one particular afternoon, our conversation drifted toward the lessons she felt children should learn early in life. Nana’s eyes sparkled warmly as she began:

"You know, one of the best lessons comes from the Buddhist parable of 'The Blind Men and the Elephant.'"

At first, I was puzzled. I'd never heard this story before, so naturally, I asked Nana to explain.

"Once," she began gently, settling comfortably into her chair, "there was a village where six blind men heard that an elephant had come into town. Curious, they set out to discover what an elephant was like."

Nana animated each character vividly:

"The first blind man touched the elephant’s side and declared confidently, 'An elephant is like a wall!'

The second grasped the tusk and insisted, 'No, it’s like a spear!'

The third held the trunk, arguing, 'You’re both wrong! It’s clearly a snake!'

The fourth felt the knee, dismissing the others, 'It’s obviously a tree trunk!'

The fifth man touched the ear, asserting, 'It’s more like a fan!'

Finally, the sixth blind man grasped the tail, concluding decisively, 'An elephant is like a rope!'"

Nana chuckled softly, amused by their confusion. Her voice then turned serious as she explained the deeper meaning of the parable:

"Each blind man was right—and yet each was also profoundly wrong. Each touched only part of the elephant, mistaking their limited experience for the entire truth. The elephant represents complex realities, truths that are far greater and more nuanced than any single perspective can reveal."

"So," I asked thoughtfully, "people disagree because they only see part of the picture?"

"Exactly!" Nana replied proudly. "Consider politics, religion, relationships, even science—each of us sees only a fragment. Empathy and openness allow us to appreciate the fuller, more beautiful reality."

That conversation stayed with me, shaping how I approach life’s complexities even today. To honor Nana's wisdom, I decided to collaborate with an AI to recreate this conversation. Using NotebookLM, I transformed our dialogue into an instant podcast—capturing her voice and lessons for anyone who cares to listen.

May her wisdom inspire empathy, openness, and curiosity in us all.
