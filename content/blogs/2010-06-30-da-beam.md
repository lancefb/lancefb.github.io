We had been planning and plotting how to get this 300 pound gorilla in the house and into place, then we decided it was overkill.  More beam than we needed, so Greg shaved off about 6 inches, reducing the weight by maybe 30%.  Then another friend happened by to ask a question about audio interfaces and offered to lend a hand with the beam.  So, we just did it!  Ahead of schedule!

After wrestling it into the house through a living room window and barely making it around a corner, we used props and ladders and furniture movers, etc., and pushed it up into place, one step at a time.  No rush.  Safety first.  

Bring on the snow.
