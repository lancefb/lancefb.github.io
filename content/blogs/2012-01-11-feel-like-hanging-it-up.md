Sometimes, things move along so slowly and the end seems impossibly distant. I want to just hang it all up.  I mean, I literally got the idea to stop all this silliness and just hang up hammocks everywhere.  Just use the house as a shell to hang around in. 

But ... somebody else beat me to it.  And they have a better view.
