I decided to go with another gas company to save money. Mistake. Didn't save money because of turnover costs. More importantly we discovered a large leak in the pipe under the house. We could smell and hear it, but not see it. I'm really glad I asked the gas dude to turn it all on and light the stove pilot light because if I did it I wouldn't have noticed the leak and it probably would have accumulated under the house until it blew.  It probably would have been an explosion large enough to blow me to Mt. Lassen.

Now the tank is padlocked because it's unsafe to use and I have to replace all the pipe under house.

Lovely.

But am I angry?  No.

I'm used to this.  This house fights me every step of the way, and always has.  But I can't - won't - let it win.
