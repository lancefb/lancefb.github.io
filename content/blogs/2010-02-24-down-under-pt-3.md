Gotta go back down there, I thought to myself.  No choice.  I assumed if I inserted myself in that hole again I would feel a little more comfortable.  So I did. I needed to squirm into the next bay to get access to the problem.  I had stuck a light down into the hole from above so that I could see the point to which to crawl.  When I managed to get into the bay, I just lay there for a bit.  Looked around.

Slowly, I inched forward and shone the light I had dragged in with me to get a sense of what was under there.  Too many pipes. I discovered that many of them were abandoned, which posed a problem for me.  When I finally made my way forward, I was stopped by some pipes that I couldn't go under or over. Some of them were abandoned water pipes, some were waste pipes I could do nothing about.

So, I crawled out backwards - with some effort - stood in the sunlight and talked with Tony about the options.

At least I gave this thing a good shot.  I now have a better understanding of my house.  A good thing.

We went back inside and I started making a bigger hole in the floor.  I was finally able to reach far enough to remove the whole broken pipe complex!  Now I know what I have to do:  widen the hole, order parts to rebuild the whole thing.  That's where it stands.
