When I first moved in late 2002, it seemed the obvious choice for a bedroom. Now it is the obvious choice for a music room.

I set it up this way temporarily. It was like this for years. But I want more. More functionality, more color, more comfort.

Finally, I started taking it apart and putting it back together again.

And chose a color. This time I decided to paint the one wall a nice, saturated color leaving the other walls bright white.

I still don't have it set up the way I'd like but I'm getting there.
