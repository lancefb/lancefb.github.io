*Work?*

*I don't have to work.*

*I don't have to do nothing*

*but eat, drink, stay black, and die.*

*This little old furnished room's*

*so small I can't whip a cat*

*with out getting fur in my mouth*

*and my landlady's so old*

*her features is all run together*

*and God knows she sure can overcharge--*

*Which is why I reckon I **does***

*have to work after all.*
