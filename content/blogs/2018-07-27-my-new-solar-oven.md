I usually don't like cooking in the Summer. Heats up my kitchen. Since I don't have A/C I want to avoid this. Here is a solution. It's kinda fun to play around with different food stuffs to cook. So far mostly it's been veggies and chicken.

It's just a glass tube, vacuum sealed with a dark coating, a simple reflector and a tray that slides inside the tube.

I'm also experimenting with cooking times and placement of the oven in my yard.
