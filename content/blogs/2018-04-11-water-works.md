Last Fall, as I was closing down the garden irrigation for the Winter, the valve broke (plastic!). Luckily it broke in the off position. I held out hope I'd be able to clamp onto some part of the old valve with a pair of vice grips and turn it back on. But looking at it closely: nope. It was going to be a project. I started digging.

I had to call out the services people to turn the water off. I cut out the old stuff, sat and stared at it for awhile then went to the hardware store for materials.

I bought a higher quality "stop and waste" valve, added some pex to the bendy section, hooked it up, turned the water back on, and ...
