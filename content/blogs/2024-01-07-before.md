[![](/images/before.webp)](/images/before.webp)

Didn't I know you?

Before.

Ages back?

When we stood together, incarnate?

Didn’t I know you?

Before the pitch pine dried up,

Before the fractious winds presaged doom,

Before the monks in their abbeys wailed in fear,

Before the sky tumbled into oblivion.

Didn’t I know you?

Before.

When I had pockets,

When I was a man?
