Weekly projects. This is a new effort. Must needs I focus on my activities or I am likely to go off and scatter.  Here is my plan. On weeks when I choose to commit to a project, I'll announce what I am going to do and what I want to achieve. I'll start on Monday of that week, work some amount on  it daily, then finish up Friday or Saturday, and write up my thoughts on Sunday.

Projects will be multi varied and include research, learning, making things, etc.

This week I'm going to read 3 books start to finish. There are:
