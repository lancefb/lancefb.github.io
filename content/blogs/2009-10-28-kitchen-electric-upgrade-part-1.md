The most significant work needs to happen in my kitchen. I need electrical and plumbing upgrades. A friend from my days as an FRC student came up to help me with phase 1 of a very much needed upgrade. This phase:

- remove old wiring in the kitchen - 110 and 220
- rewire / add wiring to accommodate electric range, new receptacles and lights

Next phase: 

- upgrade panel to 200 amp service (scheduled for Spring/Summer 2010)

I started by demolishing part of a wall in the kitchen before Mike arrived to expose the existing baffling wire job.
