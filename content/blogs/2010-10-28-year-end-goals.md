Although I've had to scale back my expectations for the hovel as a livable space in the near term, I do have some goals.  I want to be finished with the entry, media and living rooms as well as have one working toilet before 2011.

I've been taping and texturing Sheetrock and preparing for final paint in fits and starts for months. I decided to concentrate on 2 rooms: the entry and the media room.  So far, the media room has final paint and I mounted the wall fixtures. The entry is primed and I hope to put on the first layer of final paint today.
