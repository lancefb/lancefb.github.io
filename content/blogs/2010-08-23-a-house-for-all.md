When I first bought this place, it was a tragic wreck. But I didn't care.  I was actually considering stapling AstroTurf to the floor and walls, adopting ten dogs from the pound and turning it into a big playhouse with balls and sticks, plenty of good food and fun - lending credence to the term rough-housing. It was going to be a space devoted to dogs, guitars, and beer.

I started with one dog.  His name was Klezmer.  He was a wonderful companion for 7 years. He's gone on to doggie heaven.

I have a new dog now - Rou - and a cat named Spanky.  It's their house too.  Now I just have to show them how to get along.
