Some people are afraid of color in their homes.  Or maybe they just don't care about color.  I was one of those people. I thought that walls in a home should just disappear, that it's what you hang on them that matters. Maybe color on walls ***can*** take away from whatever it is you want to hang on them.  But life is too short to live in a beige world, I think.  

I know that there are many great colors that make me feel good. They make my eyes hum and make my brain send out yummy messages to my body.  I'm particularly fond of yellow-orange hues. So, I'm going to go for some color. I don't really know what I'm doing - not sure about how complemetary they'll be, but I'm going to throw some color out there and see how it feels.

Photos coming ...
