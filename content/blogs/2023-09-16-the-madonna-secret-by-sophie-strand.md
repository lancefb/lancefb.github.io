Dear Sophie,

I was deeply moved and enlightened by your latest book. Your vivid and flowing prose brought the story to life, and it was clear that you had poured your heart and soul into your research. Your decision to travel to Israel and walk on those ancient paths was a testament to your dedication to your craft. Your love of this planet is palpable. The implications you have unfurled for understanding the true history of Christianity is enormous.

> She has been recognized by the forest as one of its ancient guardians, now returned, graced with the quiet yet boundless capacity to heal, to shield the vulnerable, to be the sanctuary amidst the storm. Time itself has bowed to her essence, allowing moments of grace to unfold, where the innocent found refuge and solace in her burgeoning powers; a living testament to nature’s poetic symphony of nurturing and safeguarding its own, through a young woman reborn as a beacon of love and a sentinel of the living tapestry that embraced her.

*L.*
