It's totally my fault for not buttoning up the house. I have several places where any critter can get access to the crawl space. So, they've moved in whoever they are, and BB is going crazy trying to figure out who/what it is. I think she is worried they may make their way inside.

So, I asked ChatGTP and DALL-E to generate some text and illustrations about it.

As you lie in bed, trying to get some much-needed sleep, your dog's incessant whining grows louder and louder. You try to ignore it at first, but the high-pitched sound is driving you insane.

Finally, you can't take it anymore and drag yourself out of bed to see what's wrong. You follow your dog to the living room, where they are frantically scratching at the floorboards, their tail wagging a mile a minute.

You grab a flashlight and go outside to the place where there is access to the crawlspace, bend down to take a closer look, and to your horror, you see several pairs of glowing eyes staring back at you from underneath the house. You immediately start to panic, wondering what kind of monster could be lurking beneath your home.

But then, as you stare into those glowing eyes, you realize that it's not a monster at all - it's just a raccoon that's somehow gotten trapped under your house.

You let out a sigh of relief, but as you start to laugh at your own absurdity, your dog just looks at you with a confused expression, still convinced that there's something terrifying lurking underneath the house.

You can't help but chuckle at the silly animal's antics as you go back to bed, finally able to get some rest thanks to your faithful (and slightly paranoid) furry friend.
