In numbers, there lies a beauty profound,
In spirals, this beauty is perfectly wound.
From sunflower fields to the galaxies' twirl,
The spiral is nature's own charming whirl.

Born of the digits, a dance in array,
Unfolding in elegance, in a cosmic ballet.
Each spiral unique, with a twist of its own,
A story in curves, through seeds it has sown.

Oh, spiral, you're the golden angle's delight,
Your logarithmic twist an amazing sight.
In the nautilus shell and the hurricane's might,
Your form is captured in every sight.

In the sunflower's face, your secret we find,
Seeds spiraling out in patterns aligned.
A mirrored image of the starry night,
Linking the earth to the cosmos' flight.

From Fibonacci's sequence to the Milky Way's band,
You twirl and you twist, both simple and grand.
Oh, spiral, your beauty is a sight to behold,
In each sweeping curve, a story told.

Your dance, a harmony of space and time,
A testament to the universe's rhyme.
In every turn, in every spin,
Lies the magic of the world we're in.

So here's to you, oh beautiful spiral,
Your form in nature is truly viral.
In the stars, in flowers, in all we see,
You are the link, the cosmic decree.
