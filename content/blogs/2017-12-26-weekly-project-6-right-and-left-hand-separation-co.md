Last week I started working on one of my pet peeves, my inability to attain the dual processing that is required to play piano or accordion (or some other similar instrument).

I'm glad I did! I've made some progress. But I got sick and wasn't able to dedicate a week to it, so I'm extending the project into this week. Sicker than a dog right now -- so sad it's Cristmas. But here I am. This will be a slow week as well because of this flu, but I hope to get in as much time this way that I would have if I had a full week.

This time I want to work on more deliberate practices. Coming up with good exercises then doing to a metronome for a set length of time.

**Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday**

I continued some exercises on the accordion as well as keyboard and with body patting. Some good progress, but being sick I didn't really get to focus much.
