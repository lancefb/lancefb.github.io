Sitting on your deck with your laptop now, you realize there are so many possibilities in spiral-making.

*From wikipedia: *

> Some of the most important sorts of two-dimensional spirals include:The Archimedean spiralThe hyperbolic spiralFermat's spiralThe lituusThe logarithmic spiralThe Cornu spiralThe Fibonacci or golden spiralThe Spiral of TheodorusThe involute of a circle spiral

What to do? So many spirals, so little time. You decide to make a new spiral out there every week. You start playing around with short snippets of code that make spirals, like this:

> angle = PI * (3 - sqrt(5))for i in range(1 to 800):        t = i * angle        x = sin(t) * t        y = cos(t) * t        drawpoint(x, y)

By changing the angle, you ended up with a large variety of spirals to choose from:

You spent the next five months making spirals in your field. You forgot about the original intention - to (maybe) signal any UFO's up there. It just became an engrossing exercise in doing research and making cool stuff.

Now it's the middle of winter. Snow has covered your multitude of spirals. You toss and turn in your bed in fitful sleep.  At around 2 AM, a very bright white light descends on the house accompanied by a soft whirring sound.

Uh oh.
