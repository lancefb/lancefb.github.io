She used to  talk to me.

About her life.

Happily sometimes,

Sometimes not.

Scenes  from her inner landscape.

I would marvel at the delight she took

In her own wordplay

Watching her mouth and eyes dance,

The  sounds in her words rising and falling,

Like shadows on the wall,

Never failing to enclose me.

But after that night I took her to the cafe

To listen to the cellist

Tell his sad stories with a reedy moan,

To the un-syncopated rain,

Her  voice has gone.

She speaks not to me.

She has taken to leaving me scribbled  clues

Of her inescapable musings

On random shreds of paper,

Like breadcrumbs of thought,

And has me clinging

For the lost embrace

Of what she no longer says.
