Things have been busy at the hovel the last few weeks.  Leslie and I built 2 new planters for growing veggies. Just for fun, and just in case civilization takes a serious dive soon and we start experiencing food shortages.

Then I got a new entry.  Roofus seems to like it.

I had been borrowing a cordless drill for about a year.  Finally decided to have the internet deliver me a new one. Liked it so much I asked the internet to send me a sander and a jig saw too.  The next day a friend gave me an old jig saw. Next day after that, another friend sold me a bag of cordless tools for cheap! It included a drill, a jigsaw, a sander, etc., etc.! I'm swimming in testosterone toys here!

But the big news is that a friend is back in town to help me wrestle with this thing.  For the next 6 weeks we're going to rearrange the hovel.  The plan includes more trim work in the living room. Finishing the surfaces in the kitchen, finishing the laundry and the bathroom. Oh, and finishing the music room. In other words, I'm hoping to have the main part of the house completely liveable by the end of the summer.

We start tomorrow morning.

This is a big deal for the hovel.
