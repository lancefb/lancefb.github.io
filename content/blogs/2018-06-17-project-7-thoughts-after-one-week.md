I started learning the notes on the guitar fretboard. Harder than I thought! I have the basics down but I have to keep drilling. I looked around for ideas on how best to learn -- there are many ideas on how to do this. I tried making smart cards, which I think may be beneficial, but I 'm not certain I know which method is ultimately the best.

The ironic thing is that I've been playing consistently now for about 15 years, but the very first lesson -- learning the notes on the fretboard -- turns out to be the hardest thing. Learning the notes on the keyboard turns out to be so easy in comparison

I will need to keep drilling on this.

NOTE: I'm renaming these from weekly projects to simply projects.
