I've been avoiding this. I have had a love-hate relationship with the guitar for years. I've been playing it because it is easy and there is something undeniably beguiling about the instrument. But everyone plays guitar and it is so difficult to distinguish yourself among the crowd.

I have learned in fits and starts and gradually progressed, but lately I'm feeling stuck. I have reached a plateau of guitar mediocrity.

So I'm giving it another shot. I'm going to study fairly intensively for a year then see where I find myself.
