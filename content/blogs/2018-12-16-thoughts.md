- Gesturalist

- using hands to make stuff

- Doors?

- A space of one's own. The slipknot of convention, materials

- I do not aspire to be yet another numbed-out numbskull shuffling around the planet, rather I want to continue to hone my skill as a creative eccentric

Misc quotes, thoughts, etc

- are we not like wounded little birds defending their own lostness?

- “I asked the Earth, I asked the sea and the deeps, among the loving animals, the things that creep. I asked the winds that blow, I asked the heavens, the sun, the moon, the stars, and to all things that stand at the doors of my flesh… My question was the gaze I turned to them. Their answer was their beauty.”— ST. AUGUSTINE

- humanity's abiding martial ardour and need for the periodic spilling of blood, at great cost and with incalculable suffering.
