I image most of us like to think we're different in so many ways.  We're absolutely incomparable on some level or another.  But are we?  Look around.  We all dress remarkably alike, especially us guys. In a culture that tolerates diversity, we don't really express it much. Why?

I'll give you 5 bucks if you dress up like this and walk around town. (Submit photographic evidence to redeem.)

The same thing goes for how we live.  As I walk around in just about any residential area in the country, it amazes me how similar all the houses look. Why, when we have the ability to make almost anything we want, do we end up constructing shelter from such a diminished palette of materials, colors, shapes, interiors, furniture, accessories?

In this hovel of mine, I hope to do some things differently.  I want to be a little wacky... just because I can. If there were ever an opportunity to experiment with different ideas about how to live in a space that suits your individual needs and wants, then this place is it.

First up, no doors on bathrooms (or anywhere else).  We all do the same things in bathrooms. Why are we so neurotic about making sure no one sees us sitting on the pot? Nobody cares. It must be an unspoken, Western, depraved form of self-loathing.
