I must have this place.

A refuge, indecisive, balanced between the skies above,

the stones and worms below.

A fluctuant pile of sticks arranged anywise,

to house my solace, my memories.

A fort where, from time to time, I can linger, hovering like a mute.

A torn blanket to cover my sins.

A filthy hovel into which I drag my wounds.
