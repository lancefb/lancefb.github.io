Well, it happend, I’m back in another production at the West End Theatre in Quincy, CA.

This time it’s *Shrek: The Musical*—a tale of love, layers, and swampy redemption—and I’ve landed a small but mighty role as **Papa Ogre**. That’s right, I’ll be kicking off the show as Shrek’s dear old dad, paired up with my longtime friend and frequent stage partner, **Michelle Pfingston**, who’s playing Mama Ogre. In this go 'round, we have the dubious honor of sending off our 7 year old son (Shrek) alone into a hostile world while celebrating it in song. Ain't show business somethin'!

It’s a brief appearance, but it comes with something I don't mind doing: singing. In front of people. On purpose.

The show opens in May, just in time for **Mother’s Day**, and it’s packed with adorable characters, fairy tale chaos, and enough heart to fill a whole swamp. I’m keeping my time commitment light this round—just dipping my green toe back in the performing waters—but I couldn’t resist the pull of the stage. Especially with this cast, this crew, and this story.

Sometimes the best way to keep the joy alive is to take a small part in something big.
