Small steps forward and back, along with help from friends (thanks so much Lorne and Chris!) and here I am. My kitchen is forming and so close to being usable - in a man cave sense. Just finished the floor. I should have cold water working in the sink today, with warm/hot water from passive solar working by end of next week. Then I'll move on to putting up pantries and figuring out what to do with these plywood counter tops.  Next, maybe some painting and cabinet doors.

34 days to move-in.
