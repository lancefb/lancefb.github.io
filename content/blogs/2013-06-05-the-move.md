Found in the side yard rubble.

Unimaginable as it may seem, I finally moved into my own house, a place I have referred to as a filthy hovel for years.  Over an 8 week period - April through May, I made a concentrated push to get the most important tasks done that would allow for a minimal, man-cave-ish existence.

As it started coming together I began contemplating what living in a space really means to me.  These were a new category of thoughts. In the past I was usually in survival land. What did I need to do to keep the place from blowing up or falling down? These new thoughts - and decisions, are not any easier. And, I'm continually processing and thinking about this.  But I realized that I wanted to re-think everything.  What do I really need and want, and how do I realize it in physical form that roughly balances aesthetics, function, value and quality?

Some realizations:

- Aesthetics matter. I want to look at things that appeal to me somehow - everywhere.

- Color is fun.  I like it.

- I don't need a bedroom. 

- I want to be delighted and surprised.

- I want the right combination of clutter and un-clutter, simplicity and complexity.

- I love things that grow.

- I'm grateful for what I have.
