We made it.

*Shrek the Musical* opened this weekend—and somehow, despite all the chaos, all the costume changes, all the quick cues and frantic prop swaps—it came together.

And it came off almost without a hitch.

This show is big.

Big cast. Big voices. Big green prosthetics.

A fairytale circus on a stage held together by choreography, backstage whispers, and an unreasonable amount of faith.

I have the smallest of parts—just a moment, really.

But even from the wings, I’ve never been prouder to be part of a cast.

Everyone showed up. Everyone shined.

Opening night is behind us. The story lives now.

And I’m thrilled I got to help tell it.
