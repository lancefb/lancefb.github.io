In producing the as-built drawings, we discovered the roof was being held up by momentum.  That is, there wasn't much real support holding the roof up, so it looks as though the roof is staying up because it already is up.  Since it's sagging and big snow events may happen in the future, I decided to put in new supports.  This means tearing out the old ceiling.  A big mess. It also means new structural support, not only for the ceiling but for the floor, because support must go all the way to the ground.

We took a trip to Reno to buy a truck load of lumber - over $600 dollars worth.  We also got a break by taking up a friend on an offer of a cheap glu lam beam he had sitting around in his yard. Weathered but still strong and very heavy, it was a lot of work for the three of us to get it into my truck. This will be the main support for the ceiling and the roof.  Getting it into place will be very interesting.

With so much wiring being exposed, I decided I needed to map out all the wiring.  With some help from Mike, I made an electrical plan that helps to illustrate where the receptacles and lights go back into the panel.
