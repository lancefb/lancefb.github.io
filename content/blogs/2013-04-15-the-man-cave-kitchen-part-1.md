In order to move into The Hovel, I must have some kind of working kitchen. While I could simply eat out every day, assuming I actually wished to prepare any food at home, I suppose I could get by with a sink, a hot plate, and a camping cooler (been there).

But I actually do want to have a real kitchen because I like to eat and I want to continue evolving my cooking skills. On top of that, the kitchen at the hovel happens to be the nicest room in the house.

So, what are the essential qualities a man cave-ish kitchen should have?

Well,

- fridge

- stove 

- sink

- places to put kitchen things - cabinets/pantry

- surface area to work

- easily cleanable

- cheap

But there's more.  For me, it must go beyond spartan utilitarianism. It has to also be an interesting, somehow pleasing space to be in.

Put all those together, you're gonna get my kitchen.
