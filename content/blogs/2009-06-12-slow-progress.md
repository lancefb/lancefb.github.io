Slowly and painfully, I go on. I've gone through about 85% of my stuff. Now I need to rearrange it somewhere. As I begin work on each room, I need to move the contents somewhere to free up construction access. So, the last few days I've been working on making shelves in the shack to more efficiently hold stuff. Got my drill and saw out. Making them out of 2x4s. Slow and crude, but functional. When that's done, I'll pack it and start working on the music room.
