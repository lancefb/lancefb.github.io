Got some lights working! Wired some myself! Now I go shopping for sconces, etc. to finish up. I learned some things (you can buy a simple wall switch for 69 cents - made in the USA). Discovered I kinda like working with wire. Almost electrocuted myself when I stuck a probe into a switch - the wrong way. Got my hands dirty. (It's interesting to thrust your bare arm into a newly drilled hole in the ceiling and grope around, not knowing what your fingers will discover.) Radically increased the usability of my hovel (I can now see where the mouse turds are). Forced to make decisions that will effect how I live and are largely irreversible.

Other random thoughts:

While electricity is probably the #1 innovation in housing over the long haul, little has changed in the last 100 years. It's ridiculous that we still roam from room to room flipping little switches on the wall to channel electrons to turn lumens on/off. I'm going to replace all those switches with a more advanced system that allows for dimming and some automations, in different rooms, with the touch of a button (probably will pay for itself).
- The way we organize our housing solutions are pathetic. All those layers of wood, hand carried, hand cut, hand fastened and rotting away out of sight. Many more people could own their own homes if we just made housing in factories and delivered them in pieces.
- Straight walls and floors are a Western conceit 
All those doors everywhere - in hallways, bedrooms, bathrooms, storage spaces, kitchen cabinets - are a reflection of our uptight, sexually repressed, self-loathing, militaristic nature. (More on this in a future post.)
