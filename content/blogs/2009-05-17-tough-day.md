Today was hard.

It's bad enough having to cleanup a space that has become the domain of semi-feral cats. Cat detritus. Cats fighting, fucking, and farting and leaving signs. They used some of my good coats as shredding posts. Then there is the smell. I thought I liked cats.

But there is more.

I had to go through boxes of stuff. My stuff. From the past. And it's just the beginning. I had a hard realization today that this is more than just cleanup or creating a space for myself. I'm having to face psychological complexity. Face myself. Face my defects. Face my past.

I have always avoided facing unpleasant things. I wrestled with that today.

But, the day is done. I made a dent. Got rid of some stuff. 

Tonight, gonna drink some beer. Maybe have some Ben and Jerry's. Watch a movie.
