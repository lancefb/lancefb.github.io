We have a loose rule that everyone in the club gets to choose a book for us all to read. We're in agreement to read it - or some of it, even if we don't like it.

It's my turn!

I just ordered my copy on Amazon and I can't wait to get started. I hope y'all like this book. Sophie Strand is an amazing human being (thanks to Corinne for telling me about her). This book is hot off the press.
