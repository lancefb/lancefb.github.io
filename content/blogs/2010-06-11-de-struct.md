Alone in the hovel today - tearing it apart.

Feeling a mixture of relief, anxious anticipation and revulsion.

I wish I had done this right away after I bought this place.  I would have known what this thing is really about.  But I was not in a position to do it at the time.  I was a full time student and reeling from some major changes in my life.

One of the hard things about this is undoing some work I've done over the years. 

Gotta go backwards to go forwards sometimes.
