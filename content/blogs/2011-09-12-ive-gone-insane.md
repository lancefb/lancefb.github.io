I moved into the hovel. 

Something needed to change. I just had to do it. Things haven't progressed in months. I figured if I live there I'll have to deal with it. Even though there is no water and minimal electrical. I have to go to Save-Mor to poop and the coffe shop to wake up. Like I said, insane.
