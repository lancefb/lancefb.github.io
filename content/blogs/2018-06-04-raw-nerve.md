Today, I'm a raw nerve. I am a 360 degree, fully dimensional person. I feel things, I react, I acknowledge, I let them go.

I don't know if it's bio-rhythms, phases of the moon or some other force, but I am emotional today. I feel like a hut on a beach with no walls in the tropics. The wind blows through all day in different strengths and from different directions carrying scents from far away.
