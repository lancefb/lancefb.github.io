It started, as these things often do, with a book.

Not a new book, exactly—just *new to me*. One of those titles that practically taps you on the shoulder from across the digital aisle:

**13 Things Mentally Strong People Don’t Do.******

Catchy, right?

Enough to make me hover over the “Buy Now” button for a moment.

But then I pictured it—the sorting facility, the barcode scanner, the box making its journey across three states and four highways just so I could sit in a café and feel slightly more emotionally fortified. And I thought: *maybe not.***

So I let the AI do the lifting.

In a few minutes, I had a clean, thoughtful summary. A clickable mind map. A podcast voiced by two eerily calm digital humans, swapping insights over a topic they technically can’t feel.

And honestly?

It was enough.

I didn’t burn any fuel. I didn’t wait three days. I didn’t add another object to the great domestic archive of unread personal development literature.

I got what I came for. And then I lingered.

Because sometimes strength isn’t about doing more.

Sometimes it’s about knowing when *not* to.

And loitering with a latte, apparently, still makes the cut.

Here's some clickable stuff:

Oh, and speaking of loitering:
