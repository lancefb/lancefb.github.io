Now that Greg Willis is here to help me with this ... project, we have developed a plan.  The first step is to map out what is here and put it down on paper in the form of drawings.  This is often called "as-built" drawings.  Important to have these for communication purposes.  This will probably take another couple of days to finish up.

It means that Greg, because he is wiry and nimble, gets to crawl around in the attic spaces and in the below-the-floor spaces with a camera, notepad and measuring tape.
