*I'm not sure what this is. It started as a dream, I think. I wrote some words down about the feeling I had, about the character that appeared. I thought it might be a song, but no. It's just this:*

She wakes up at three AM, and blinks to clear her head. 

There is no sound, the house is still and dark.

Silent, decisive foot steps - in seconds she's at the door.

Grabs her keys, her bag, doesn't bother to make the bed.

She hesitates on the back porch and looks out at the night.

Though shaking, she knows. 

She must -- she has to go.

Lets the door close behind her, gets into her car.

In a moment, the road ahead is an unknown life.

> When there's nothing left to do, and no one left to blame, hard times are harder, when ya gotta make a change.
> 
> When there's just the sound of blue, you move to a whole new game.
> 
> 'Cause no one ever remains the same.

As she drives she thinks the way it was. 

All those years just making do.

Empty men, empty jobs, endless, empty bottles of booze.

Can't forget that first time look in the mirror.

The ache, the aging face.

Broke down right then and knew she had to make a change

> She moves, she moves, she knows what she's gotta do.
> 
> Pomp and circumstance - graduate to a whole new school.
> 
> Learn how to win with a brand new set of rules.
> 
> Use your heart, make it work, make all new friends.
> 
> Push down the fears you feel.
> 
> Have the courage to mend.
> 
> 'Cause staying 'round here amounts to nothing in the end.
