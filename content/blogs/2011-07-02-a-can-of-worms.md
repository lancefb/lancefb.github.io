Nothing is simple in this place.  I just wanted to texture and paint a tiny 4' X 6' room - a laundry room.

It had lots of holes and some unpainted parts.  So I took off a piece of wood acting as a window frame when I discovered this one piece of wood was actually holding the window in place!  So we took a closer look. Turns out the wall was basically missing behind the window. Great. Not even any studs to attach a frame to.  No header. This means tearing into the wall to add studs in order to make a frame for the window.

Then of course, once we took off the exterior sheathing and the substantial bracing, there is no insulation.

So, what started as a texture and paint job has turned into an ordeal.  Come to think of it, nothing has been easy here. This whole place is a can of worms. Oh how I wish it were otherwise.

What's worse, is as we're patching things back to together, I notice the window frame right next to this one doesn't look quite right either.  Uh oh.

I guess I'm a worm farmer.
