I tried taking on a rewiring project for my old RV. It appears I bit off more than I could chew for my experience level and the time I had. The weather was a partial factor. Anyway, it's far from done. I did learn a lot though and I'm keen to continue 'cause 'lectricity is fun!

Here's what I did accomplish:

- read two different books on 12 volt electronics

- drew several wiring diagrams

- ordered and bought a lot of electrical components from online and local sources

- completed the on/off switch to connect one of the house batteries to the chassis battery allowing charging of that battery by the alternator (photo below)

- did some carpentry to allow for separation of batteries from the charger and a mounting platform for the other 2 switches

- installed 3 out of 6 (or so) LED lights in the coach, replacing the old incandescent units and verified they are working

- created an electrical requirement worksheet

Switch #3: connects house battery to chassis battery via on/off switch

What remains:

- more LED lights

- bring in the other house battery

- mount the charger and the 2 switches 

- wire them up properly

- remove old fuse box and replace with the new fuse system

- mount negative buss bar and wire it

- stretch new thicker wire from the battery bank under the coach and up to the new fuse box

- cut out and mount the USB socket panel, connect to fuse box

- remove the old refrigerator  and a new 12 volt model adding 12V and 120V service

- extend 120V line to the new charger (next to fridge)

Down the road:

- solar!

So, that's it! It was fun and instructional, but time to move on to the next project.
