In order to finish the wiring job, we had to get under the house to run the new wiring to the panel. Looked around and discovered no easy way to get under. This surprised me. Although I've never been under there, I thought I'd be able to when necessary. Nope.

We ended up having to drill a 2 SF hole in my kitchen floor!

I was shocked that there were no fewer than 5 layers of wood comprising the floor (it'll be hidden under cabinets). On the positive side, that hole will also allow for access when it's time for the great plumbing upgrade. Oh how I'm looking forward to that!

Yesterday, I finished putting the last of the 4 new lighting cans in the ceiling. It was a struggle (remember, we're talking non-standard construction here), but it's done. Two of them are switched up and working. Hope to wire a switch up to the other two today. These switches are all temporary. I want (depending on the price) to install some automated switches you can turn on and off and dim from a distance.

This electrical upgrade is just about done, thanks to Mike Hulbert. Before I cover it all up with sheetrock, I need to look into plumbing issues that might effect this wall.
