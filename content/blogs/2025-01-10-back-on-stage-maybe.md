So… I’m auditioning for some kind of role in *Shrek the Musical*.

That’s right. Community theater has pulled me back in—this time with ogres, dragons, talking donkeys, and musical numbers that are catchier than they have any right to be.

I’m going for a small role. Nothing too demanding. Something fun, something weird, something I can do without torching my calendar or my sanity.

Why? Because the stage still calls, even if it’s just whispering now. And because saying yes to small things can sometimes keep the big parts of life moving.

I’ll share more once I know who I’ll be playing (and whether or not I have to wear green face paint). 

Cue the fairytale fanfare.
