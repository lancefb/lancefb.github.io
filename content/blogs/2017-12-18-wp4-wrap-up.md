This week I split my efforts between two musical pursuits: practicing for a performance and practicing chord inversions on my accordion keyboard.

I made a mistake at the performance when I ditched one of the songs I had practiced and decided at the last minute to do a song that I hadn't practiced. Guess what. Didn't go great. I mangled it. The other song which was actually harder went well.

I also practiced for keyboard knowledge by working on chord inversions. These I have to do by feel because it's awkward to see the keyboard on accordions, unlike piano players. I worked on the C Major triad. As I worked up the keyboard, I made the transition, then called out the order bottom to top: 1, 3, 5, then 3, 5, 1, then 5, 1, 3.

I spent the vast majority of my time on the performance pieces, very little on the inversions, which make me wonder if splitting a project like this is very effective.
