Grass high under apple trees,

The bark of the trees rough and sexual,

the grass growing heavy and uneven.

We cannot bear disaster, like

the rocks--

swaying nakedly

in open fields.

One slight bruise and we die!

I know no one on this train.

A man comes walking down the aisle.

I want to tell him

that I forgive him

that I forgive him, that I want him

to forgive me.

ROBERT BLY
