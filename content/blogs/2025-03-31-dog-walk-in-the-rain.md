Rainy all day, but they need their exercise.

The park, emptied of everyone

except me and the dogs—

tails up, noses down,

Bella with her tug ball,

oblivious to weather,

or maybe made for it.

No voices. No cars.

Just the soft drip of water meeting earth,

and the rhythm of paws

in soaked grass.

We got wet.

We didn’t mind. Nothing a car towel can't fix.

The world had stepped out,

and left the silence to us.
