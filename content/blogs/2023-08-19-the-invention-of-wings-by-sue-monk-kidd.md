Thanks Sue. Nice book. You gutted me.

The cover of the book is innocuous enough, but wading into those pages, I found myself wandering through a landscape both haunting and visceral. It was far from a meandering journey of fiction, but a raw traversal through history's harshest terrains. Each word, each account, felt like a shard of glass, piercing and cutting me.

Yes, there are silhouettes of resilience and courage to be found. But for me this is a tale of chains, pain, and the heavy curtain of despair.

This book, it's not just a story. It's an echo from the past, and for some, a whisper of both caution and hope. Not so for me. Because, while I hope the Grimke's and Handful somehow made it through to a better life, I'm haunted by the knowledge that most just sank into an abyss of human cruelty, profound inequality, debilitating injustice, and monstrous, indefensible atrocities.

I'm haunted by the thought of all those innumerable lives diminished, dreams crushed, and futures stolen.

We all have to bear the burden of what happened there. The [psychological reverberations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8352535/) from that era will continue into the future through [transgenerational trauma.](https://humantold.com/blog/transgenerational-trauma-how-the-psychological-stress-of-enslavement-impacts-black-americans-today/)

I need to get my head into another book so I can begin to leave these images behind me.
