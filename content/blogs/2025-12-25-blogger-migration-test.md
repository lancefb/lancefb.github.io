I'm migrating from Blogger to Hugo to get full control over my content with MD

## The Plan

I'm migrating because:

1. **Markdown native** - Write in plain text
2. **Git-based** - Version control for blog posts
3. **PAI integration** - budd can help me write
4. **Fast and free** - GitHub Pages hosting

## What I'm Testing

- Post formatting
- Images (coming next)
- Links
- Code blocks
```python
def hello_hugo():
    return "This is awesome!"
```

Let's see how this looks!
