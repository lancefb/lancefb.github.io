I finally finished this electrical rebuild in the Beaver.  I ordered all the parts I thought I needed, did more research, and started cutting, splicing, and crossing my fingers.

As it is now, there are 3 batteries that are interconnected with cable and switches. There is the starting battery that everyone needs because it gets the whole show on the road. It is connected to a second battery as a backup if needed. I can switch it on if necessary to assist the starting battery and it can get juice from the alternator to keep it topped off. The third battery is a deep cell version that fuels the interior lights, etc.

I bought a half-dozen 12-volt lights, wire, cabling, switches, a high-end charger/conditioner, and other miscellaneous devices like cell phone charger plugs.

I have some solar panels but have no plans to integrate them into this project.

I have yet to put this all into practice by going on a trip. Hopefully, that will change soon.

It feels good to have completed this. I know it's not a professional job, but it seems to be working and I learned a ton about 12-volt electronics. 👍

(Actually, there is a little more to do, but I'm calling it good.)
